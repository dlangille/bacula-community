--- Test Execution

In order to properly execute all the tests,
some Environment Variables must be created:

BE_PLUGIN_TYPE (Specifies which Plugin should be tested)

BE_PLUGIN_VERSION (Specifies which Plugin Version should be tested)

BE_PLUGIN_URL (Specifies the URL where the Plugins Data Source exists)

BE_PLUGIN_USER (Specifies the username that should be used by the Plugin)

BE_PLUGIN_PWD (Specifies the password that should be used by the Plugin)

Example:

export BE_PLUGIN_TYPE=swift

export BE_PLUGIN_VERSION=1

export BE_PLUGIN_URL=http://192.168.0.5:8080

export BE_PLUGIN_USER=test:tester

export BE_PLUGIN_PWD=testing


To run the tests (from the projects root folder):

python3 -m unittest discover tests/test_baculaswift

-- Manual Testing

It is possible that Swift containers and objects might be needed
to be created in order to do manual testing. In this case, the
python-swiftclient should be accessed directly.

The python-swiftclient (called "swift") tool is a command line utility
for communicating with an OpenStack Object Storage (swift) environment.
It allows one to perform several types of operations.

In order for properly use this tool (with legacy authenticaton),
four Environment Variables must be created

ST_AUTH_VERSION
ST_AUTH
ST_USER
ST_KEY

Those values could be, for example (if you are using SAIO - Swift All in One):

export ST_AUTH_VERSION=1.0
export ST_AUTH=http://192.168.0.5:8080/auth/v1.0
export ST_USER=test:tester
export ST_KEY=testing

The complete list of operations that this tool can perform is shown
in this link:

https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/cli/index.html#examples

-- Swift ACL

On Swift, only Accounts and Containers (buckets) have Access Control Lists.
In order to create ACLs on Containers with the "swift" command-line tool,
please check this link:

https://www.swiftstack.com/docs/cookbooks/swift_usage/container_acl.html

-- Swift XATTRS

On Swift, both Containers (buckets) and Objects (files) may have Extended Attributes.

In order to create XATTRs on both with the "swift" command-line tool,
please check this link:

https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/cli/index.html#swift-post
