===== Baculum upgrade notes =====

- Upgrade from 9.x and 11.x to 11.0.5.5

[Baculum Common]
The two notes below apply ONLY updating Baculum installed manually using source
archive and can be also useful for package maintainers.

All external dependencies have been moved to the protected/vendor directory.
If you use Baculum installed manually from source archive, during update please
copy this new path from the archive to the destination path. If you use Baculum
installed from binary packages, no additional action is required because
packages handle this change automatically.

Second new path to copy for upgrade in manual installation is the PHP PSR-4
autoloader file located in path protected/autoload.php. For updates using binary
packages no change is required.

- Upgrade from 9.x to 9.6.4

[Baculum Web]
There has been introduced new way of managing users. If you use default Basic
authetication - no additional change is required. If you use custom auth method
realized by web server - no additional change is requred. If it is LDAP auth
please consider switching to new LDAP auth method in Baculum Web.

Import users
Importing Basic users from default user file to Baculum Web is done automatically.
If you would like to import LDAP users to Baculum Web, you can use import option
available on the Security page.

New dependency
There has been added a new dependency. It is PHP LDAP module. There is required to
install this module (php-ldap package) after upgrade. Appropriate information
about this dependency is displayed on the Baculum Web page. If you install Baculum
using binary packages, no additional action is needed because this dependency will
be installed automatically.
